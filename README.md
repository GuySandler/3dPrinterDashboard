# 3dPrinterDashboard
for hack club

after I upgraded my camera to the wyze OG I relized it doesn't work with octoprint, but it does give me access from anywhere. To simplify my experience I decided to install android and use the octoapp combined with the wyze app in split screen to create a great dashboard.

I made a dashboard for my 3d printer out of a random pi 4 and a 7inch touchscreen screen I found.
I installed lineageOS from https://konstakang.com/devices/rpi4/LineageOS17.1/ and added the play store to it by following the instructions on the bottom of the page.
it's great and looks great in split screen.
